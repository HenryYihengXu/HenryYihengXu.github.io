I'm a third year Computer Science Ph.D student at University of Maryland, College Park. I'm a member of [**PSSG**](https://pssg.cs.umd.edu) working with [Prof. Abhinav Bhatele](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~bhatele/index.html#) on HPC topics. My current research concentration is performance analysis and modeling, especially on parallel I/O. I am interested in learning more about state-of-the-art HPC performance optimization methods, and applying them to solve real world problems.
