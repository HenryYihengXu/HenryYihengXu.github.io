title: Parallel I/O Performance Analysis and Modeling
---

The research project is to build an efficient file system for high-performance
computing (HPC) applications. Developing user-level filesystems for specific
workloads requires analyzing the I/O behavior of parallel programs, and
identifying I/O bottlenecks and limitations. Based on the analysis, strategies
can be developed to improve I/O performance.  The project involves studying the
I/O behavior of several HPC benchmarks and applications. It also involves
analyzing the collected data to identify bottlenecks, and then developing
strategies to mitigate those bottlenecks.
